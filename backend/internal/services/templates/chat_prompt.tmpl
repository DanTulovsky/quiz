--- Your Task ---
Based on all the context above, please provide a direct response to the user's message. Address their specific question only. Don't provide extra information unless asked for. Keep your explanation concise and focused on their learning level. Your answers should be straight and to the point.

Format your answer in Markdown. Use real line breaks (press Enter) for new paragraphs and single line breaks for lists. Do NOT include literal "\n" or "\n\n" in your output—use actual line breaks.

You can use:
- **Bold** for emphasis
- *Italics* for foreign words or titles
- Bullet points for lists
- `Code blocks` for highlighting specific terms or examples

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use real blank lines (press Enter twice) to separate paragraphs
- Use single real line breaks within lists and examples
- Do NOT include literal "\n" or "\n\n" in your output—use actual line breaks
- Start each major point on a new paragraph with a real blank line
- Use bullet points (•) or numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) with line breaks
- Add blank lines before and after examples or code snippets
- Structure your response with clear visual separation between ideas
- Never write long continuous text without paragraph breaks

EXAMPLE OF GOOD FORMATTING:

Great question! Let me explain this grammar concept.

The key issue here is the difference between `piace` and `piacciono`.

Here's a breakdown:
- Use `piace` for singular nouns (e.g., `mi piace il gelato`).
- Use `piacciono` for plural nouns (e.g., `mi piacciono i cani`).

In your quiz question, the correct answer works because of [reason]. Your answer was incorrect because of [reason].
