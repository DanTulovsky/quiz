CRITICAL JSON STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON that matches this exact structure:
{{.SchemaForPrompt}}

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON
- Do NOT include any explanations, markdown, or code blocks
- Do NOT include any reasoning or thinking
- Do NOT wrap the JSON in ```json or ``` code blocks
- Your entire response must be valid JSON only
- Ensure all string values are properly quoted
- Ensure all arrays have exactly 4 items for options
- Start your response directly with [ and end with ]
- Do NOT add any formatting, indentation, or extra whitespace


Do NOT format like this:
```json
[{...}]
```
Just return the raw JSON array directly, with no extra text or formatting.
