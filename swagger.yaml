  description: API specification for the AI-powered adaptive language learning quiz application. All `date-time` fields in this specification use RFC3339 timestamps and include timezone offsets (e.g., `2025-08-15T16:33:19Z` or `2025-08-15T12:33:19-04:00`). Servers MUST return timestamps with offsets and clients MUST parse them respecting the offset.
