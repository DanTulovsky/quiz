# LingoLearn iOS App

This directory contains the source code for the LingoLearn iOS application.

## Getting Started

This is a scaffold for a Swift/SwiftUI project. To turn this into a fully functional Xcode project, you should:

1.  Open Xcode.
2.  Create a new project (`File -> New -> Project...`).
3.  Choose the "App" template under the "iOS" tab.
4.  Name the project "LingoLearn" and choose "SwiftUI" for the interface and "Swift" for the language.
5.  Save the project in a temporary location.
6.  Close the newly created project.
7.  Copy the `LingoLearn.xcodeproj` file from the temporary location into this `ios/` directory.
8.  Replace the newly created `LingoLearn` folder in the temporary location with the `LingoLearn` folder from this directory.
9.  Open the `LingoLearn.xcodeproj` in Xcode. You should see the files created by the agent.

This manual step is necessary because an `.xcodeproj` file and its configuration are complex and are best generated by Xcode itself.
