 * Custom hook for loading snippets for a specific question.

 * This hook implements async loading to ensure question display is not blocked

 * is displayed.
 *
 * Performance characteristics:
 * - Automatically disabled when questionId is null/undefined
 * - Uses React Query for caching and deduplication
 * - Stale time set to prevent unnecessary refetches
 *
 * @param questionId - The ID of the question to fetch snippets for
 * @returns Object containing snippets array, loading state, and error state
