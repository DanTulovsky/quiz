# Word of the Day Implementation Plan

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All features have been implemented and tested.

## Completed Features

### Backend
- ✅ Database migration for `word_of_the_day_assignments` table
- ✅ Models: `WordOfTheDayAssignment` and `WordOfTheDayDisplay`
- ✅ `WordOfTheDayService` with intelligent selection algorithm
  - Prioritizes vocabulary questions (70%) over snippets (30%)
  - Avoids repeating words within 60 days
  - Prefers recent snippets (last 30 days)
- ✅ API handlers for:
  - GET `/v1/word-of-day/:date` - JSON response
  - GET `/v1/word-of-day/:date/embed` - HTML iframe version
  - GET `/v1/word-of-day/history` - Historical words
- ✅ Email service integration with beautiful HTML template
- ✅ User preference field: `word_of_day_email_enabled`
- ✅ Worker tasks for daily assignment and email sending
- ✅ Integration tests

### Frontend
- ✅ React hook: `useWordOfTheDay`
- ✅ Desktop page: `WordOfTheDayPage.tsx`
- ✅ Mobile page: `MobileWordOfTheDayPage.tsx`
- ✅ Embeddable page: `WordOfTheDayEmbedPage.tsx`
- ✅ Navigation menu items added
- ✅ Routes configured

### API & Documentation
- ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI definitions updated
- ✅ Frontend API types generated

## Remaining Tasks
- ⏳ Fix E2E test file for word-of-day endpoints
- ⏳ Run `task test-e2e-api` to verify all endpoints

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE word_of_the_day_assignments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    assignment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    source_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'vocabulary_question' or 'snippet'
    source_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE(user_id, assignment_date)
);
```

### Selection Algorithm
1. Check for existing assignment (return if found)
2. Get user's recent words (last 60 days) to avoid repeats
3. Try vocabulary questions first (70% probability):
   - Filter by user's language and level
   - Exclude recently assigned
   - Random selection
4. Fallback to snippets (30% probability):
   - Prefer recent snippets (last 30 days)
   - Filter by user language
5. If no suitable word found, return error

### Worker Integration
- Runs during scheduled worker cycles
- Assigns words for users with language/level preferences
- Sends emails at configured reminder hour
- Respects user email preferences
